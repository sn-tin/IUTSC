Having shown us a preview of her glamorous ‘greeting’ to the end of her 20s, IU is back with her 5th full-length album [LILAC] along with the scent of spring. Unlike the first album of her 20s, [Spring of a Twenty Year Old], which was full of her honest and fresh emotions, IU’s full-length album in 4 years [LILAC] captures her emotions which have matured over the years, through 10 tracks showing varied perspectives of her 20s thus far.

This time, IU participated again as a producer, composer and also wrote the full lyrics for the album and had new collaborations with various local and international top artistes, experimenting with new genres and releasing high quality songs, raising expectations for IU’s ongoing musical transformation as she enters her 30s.

Top music video production teams in Korea, VM Project (Celebrity, Flu), Flipevil (LILAC, Epilogue) and Sunny Visual (Coin) also participated for this album. The sensory videos, each with unique styles, created a great synergy with IU’s music.

The lilac flower which is used as both the album title and title track, represents ‘first love’ and ‘memories of youth’. Here is a greeting from a glamorous yet slightly lonely  IU, to show her gratitude to everyone who has read the first page of her 20s to the last page.
